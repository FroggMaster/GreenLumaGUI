# Introduction to CN-GreenLumaGUI :

![](./Pictures/icon.png)

Developed with WPF, this application manages the application list folder for the Steam tool [“GreenLuma”](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=103709)

A standalone, installation-free file allows complete operations with just mouse clicks.

The primary purpose of its creation is to enable friends who are completely unfamiliar with computers to operate GreenLuma to unlock games.

As it uses WPF, it requires the .NET runtime and runs exclusively on Windows systems.

## FAQ :

#### Q: How do I use it? Which button do I press?

A: First, add some games in the software, then select the games you want to unlock in the "Game List," and click "Start Steam." Just wait for Steam to launch.

Can't find the "Start Steam" button? It's probably now called "Close Steam" because Steam is already running.

* Steam must be launched via the button; manually launching Steam doesn't count. You can close this application after launching Steam. *

* Starting Steam first and then selecting games won't count. If you change your game selections, you need to close Steam and then relaunch it through the software for the changes to take effect. *


#### Q: Can this game be unlocked?

A: I don't know.

With an immense variety of games available, it's impossible for me to have played and tested every game you might play. For the question of whether "a certain game can be played," the only criterion is practice.

Though I can't tell you which games are playable, I can tell you which definitely aren't—

Games that need to redirect to a third-party platform definitely won't work, such as Ubisoft's (e.g., Assassin's Creed) or EA's games (e.g., Battlefield).

Online games that require constant internet connection probably won't work (e.g., Rainbow Six Siege, also a Ubisoft game).

Denuvo-encrypted games definitely won't work.

The indicators of incompatibility are: 

(1) even when up-to-date, the game continuously prompts for updates, indicating it won't work, and 

(2) if the game displays an "application error" message upon launching, it means it won't work.

However, under special circumstances, some online games might work — if you've shared a game from someone else, and it happens to lack verification, you could potentially join online games through Steam. Interestingly, most single-player games with multiplayer features work this way.

If I already have shared games, why go through this process?

Because sometimes, it's not just you who wants to play. Steam's "Family Sharing" function doesn't actually share games; it's more like lending out a game. Meaning, if you've shared your library with five people, only one person can play at a time. The rest have no games to borrow.

In other words, Steam's game sharing allows only one person among you and five friends to play at a time. Six people playing together online is impossible. However, if you unlock a game using this software, even if someone else is already playing it, as long as you still have sharing privileges, you can play normally.

Of course, games that the developer has set as unsharable on Steam, like GTA5, won't work.


#### Q: I found that in the new Family Sharing, we have only one copy of a game, and it prompts that it can't be launched when multiple people try to play at the same time.

A: There are four possibilities.

1: In the new Family Sharing version, the order of play is important. Have all family members who were playing this game quit first. The person who owns the game should not unlock it. Instead, have other family members who don't own but want to play use a tool to unlock and open Steam. Then everyone can enter the game together.

2: It's possible that an update in Steam has reduced the actual limit of how many games can be unlocked. Try removing the unlocks for other games and DLCs to free up space, then only unlock the game you want to play. Wait for a software update to fix the issue.

3: There might be a genuine issue with certain games, which would require an update from the original developer for the DLL file. Generally, these issues are resolved in the next version of the developer's update. I'll have to wait for that too.

4: If you're trying to play a testing branch of the game, this problem might occur as the software may not support test versions.


#### Q: I've opened the software, but I can't see any games in my library, or I can't download games from my library, or the download completes instantly with an empty package.

A: This is the normal working state of the software. The current situation is that the download function does not work.

If this is a game you or your family owns, try selecting the Depot for this game in the manifest file. Alternatively, you can close both Steam and the software, open Steam normally, and then proceed with the download.

If you don’t own the game, try importing a manifest file and key exported by someone else using the software. Then, use the Depot buttons in the software to manually trigger the download. If you don’t have a manifest file and key shared by someone else, you’ll need to resort to cloud storage, another person’s account, sharing from someone else, or other means to download the games you want to play.

If you thought this software could allow you to download games you don’t own without any conditions, you may have misunderstood its functionality.


#### Q: How to use Manifest-related features?

You can treat this page as a list of locally installed games, so you don't need to search through the store page every time - this is the simplest usage.

The core purpose of Manifest functionality is game downloading, but with conditions:  
1. Someone who owns the game must voluntarily share Manifest files and decryption keys with others.  
2. Shared Manifests/keys are version-specific and expire after game updates.

Basic downloading doesn't require Family Sharing, making it suitable for sharing offline single-player games between friends through Steam, eliminating the need to send entire game files. For online play, purchasing through Steam is still required.

Alternatively, you can find shared Manifests on GitHub repositories or niche forums and import them.  
*(Note: Some .st format keys shared on Steamtools forums use unclear encoding rules and are unsupported.)*

**For game sharers**  
1. Start downloading the target game (partial download is acceptable, pause after beginning).  
2. Open software → Scan Manifests → Find the game → Click "Export" → Save ZIP file.  
3. Send the generated ZIP to others.

**For receivers**  
1. Drag the ZIP containing Manifest/key into the software window until "Added successfully" appears.  
*(If dragging fails: Disable UAC or use "File Import" button)*  
2. Launch Steam through the software. Wait for full startup.  
*(Auto-checked depots during import; verify manually if unchecked)*  
3. Open "Manifests" → Find the game matching ZIP name → Click "Download" button next to game title.  
*(Critical: Must click the download button for the correct game本体 with matching store APPID)*

**Common Issues**  

##### Q: Download completes instantly but game files are empty  
A: Manifest not imported. Follow the import process above.

##### Q: "Game config unavailable" after long wait  
A: Wrong download button clicked. Only use the download button for the main game depot (outer box with store APPID).

##### Q: "No License" error  
A: Steam not unlocked properly. Either:  
- Launched Steam without the software  
- Forgot to restart Steam after new Manifest import  
Solution: Check game/depots → Relaunch Steam via software.

##### Q: "Content still encrypted" during download  
A: Missing/invalid decryption key. Re-import correct Manifest files.

##### Q: "Content config unavailable"  
A: Manifest expired. Possible reasons:  
1. Game updated - old Manifest invalid  
2. Sharer's Manifest outdated (needs recent download/update)  
3. Manifest deleted after uninstall - reimport required  

~~Rarely caused by Steam cache issues - try rebooting.~~  
*User Lioncky notes: New games often have this issue due to Steam server optimization. See [this issue](https://github.com/clinlx/CN_GreenLumaGUI/issues/42). Shared Manifests may expire if sharer becomes inactive.*


#### Q: The library shows I have DLC, but why can't I unlock it in-game?

A: If the game checks online whether you've purchased the DLC, there's nothing you can do, regardless of what Steam shows.

For single-player games, more often than not, it's because, as mentioned earlier, there is no "download DLC" function by default.

Some DLCs can be unlocked because, for the game, it's just a marker. All game content is already downloaded to your computer; you just need to trick the game into thinking you have the DLC, and you can play.

But for many games, if you haven't purchased the DLC, it won't download the game files. Since you can't download, lacking game files means even if the game lets you play extra content, you can't play without those files.

In theory, if you could download the DLC by borrowing someone else's Steam account that has purchased the DLC, then you could play it.


#### Q: Some of the DLC is unlocked, as if it's cut off in the middle of a pack, with successful unlocks before a certain point and failed ones after.

A: This may be due to a Steam update reducing the limit of unlocks. You can temporarily fix this by un-checking other unlocked items to make space for the DLC.

Ultimately, waiting for a software update should resolve the issue.


#### Q: After clicking to start the game, even waiting a million years, the game doesn't launch, staying stuck on starting.

A: Compatibility mode has a small bug but allows more computers to start Steam normally. So, I've left it on by default.

In the settings panel at the very bottom, turn off compatibility mode and administrator mode. If you can still open Steam normally after that, then you can open the game normally.


#### Q: What should I do if I encounter a launch exception stating "The system cannot execute the specified program"?

Note: In rare cases, this message may appear in your language (based on system language).

A: This issue is likely related to Windows Defender. Checking [this issue](https://github.com/clinlx/CN_GreenLumaGUI/issues/12) might help clarify:

It mentions that adding the directory "C:\tmp\exewim2oav.addy.vlz" to the whitelist in Windows Security Center resolved the problem.

However, you should first ensure that the prerequisite VC++ runtime library is correctly installed.


#### Q: What should I do if I get an "Access is denied" launch exception?

Note: In rare cases, this message may appear in your language (based on system language).

A: This problem seems to occur quite frequently. First, make sure to update to the latest version (to confirm this issue still exists in the current version).

There have been resolved cases before, but I only know some of the reasons, which may not apply to all situations:

1. (Speculation) The direct cause of this error might be "insufficient permissions." There could indeed be a permissions issue, so try adjusting the Steam launch permissions to "Administrator" at the bottom of the settings page.
2. Ensure that the prerequisite VC++ runtime library is correctly installed.
3. This issue might be caused by third-party antivirus software blocking the operation. Try temporarily disabling it?
4. If your system version is too old (e.g., Windows 7) and compatibility mode isn't enabled, this might cause the problem.
5. If you've successfully launched it before but can't now, it's possible that a previous process didn't close properly and is still using file resources. Try restarting your computer.
6. If you've checked everything above and still can't find the cause, the last resort is to try launching in compatibility mode, then exit the software, and finally manually run C:\tmp\exewim2oav.addy.vlz\DLLInjector_bak.exe to see what kind of prompt the system gives.


#### Q: Why is the limit 130 games?

A: Since Greenluma isn't open source, the maximum of 130 unlocks is a hardcoded limit by the author, for unknown reasons. It used to be unlimited, but the author likely encountered a bug and thus imposed this limit. I can't resolve this.


#### Q: I've been able to use this software, but suddenly today, Steam won't pop up when I open it.

A: I've encountered this situation too but don't know why. It might be that Steam is stuck. Some people I asked said closing the software and logging into Steam normally, changing to a different account, or restarting the computer a few times might solve the issue. You can try these methods. Since the cause is unidentified and the impact is minor, it's not pursued further. (If a problem arises, first check if other games also can't be unlocked, to rule out game-specific issues.)


#### Q: Can it be used on non-Windows platforms?

A: No. It's impossible. From the original GreenLuma software to the DLL injector, to WPF, none can be used outside the Windows platform.


#### Q: I've encountered various odd issues and just can't open Steam.

A: I've tried my best to ensure the software installs and runs without issues on all the machines I could test. However, strange bugs are still numerous. In the logs, I've even seen errors due to "the absence of cmd.exe in the Windows system," a problem for which I can find no cause unless you allow me to remote into your computer to compile the code and try.

Switching compatibility mode in settings can solve some problems.

To ensure continuity, this software directly hides or discards many of GreenLuma's logs and prompts, which may affect pinpointing the issue's cause. Thus, if all else fails, you might consider abandoning my software shell and directly using the original GreenLuma to launch Steam, as it might more clearly indicate where the problem lies.

For any other questions or unresolved issues, feel free to submit an issue on GitHub to inform me.


## Built-in Files :

For immediate use, the following files are included (in base64 encoded form):

DLLInjector.exe

GreenLuma_2025_x86.dll


## How to Manually Replace the Tool's Internal Files

Follow these steps to make the tool prioritize your own files:

[1] Create a folder named "override" in the directory C:\tmp\exewim2oav.addy.vlz (full path C:\tmp\exewim2oav.addy.vlz\override)

[2] Replace the DLL file: Place your GreenLuma_2025_x86.dll file into the "override" folder, without renaming it.

[3] (Optional) Replace the injector: Put your DLLInjector.exe file into the "override" folder, also without renaming it (this is only for normal mode. The official injector isn't used in "compatibility mode," so this step won't apply).

[4] (Optional) Replace the Injector Configuration: In the "override" folder, create a file named configTemp.ini and fill it out based on how the DLLInjector/configTemp.ini file is structured on my Git repository. (Again, this is only for normal mode. The official injector isn't used in "compatibility mode," so this step won't apply.)

The tool will neither delete nor modify this folder. Remember to remove it later if you no longer need the replacements.
